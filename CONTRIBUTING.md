## Contributing

<p>1. Fork gallery to <code>username/color-changer</code>. <br/>
2. Clone the project:</p>

```
$ git clone https://github.com/{username}/color-changer
```

<p>3. Create your feature branch:</p>

````
$ git checkout -b my-new-feature
```

<p>4. Code your awesome feature idea. <br/>
5. Commit your changes:</p>

```
$ git commit -am 'Add some feature'
```

<p>6. Push to the branch:</p>

```
$ git push origin my-new-feature
```

<p>7. Create a new Pull Request to the <code>development</code> branch.</p>

If everything checks out, and we like your pull request, we'll merge it to `development`.  After merging some other branches to development (besides yours), we'll merge all of the new features to master, where they'll be part of the new release!
